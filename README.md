# Portable-Face-Mask-Carrier
## Problem Description
When people go out to eat and drink, they often tend to put their mask in a trouser pocket with phone, keys, and headphones, which is not very hygienic. And the mask can get contaminated with bacteria and viruses. This can lead to germ infections due to talking off the mask regularly for brief intervals. Therefore, a separate place to put the mask is needed. We decided to build a portable face mask carrier to address this problem.
## Product Features
- UVC Light System to sanitize the area of the face mask
- Hand sanitizer container which can hold disinfectant liquid for more than 5 days.
- Power bank which has a 6000mAh capacity and 1000+ rechargeable cycles.
- An Enclosure which is portable and fashionable that can carry a single face mask.
